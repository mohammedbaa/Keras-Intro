üöÄ Excited to share a project I've been working on! üöÄ

I recently completed an introductory project on deep learning using Keras, a powerful Python library for building and training neural networks. Here's a glimpse of what I've covered:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Classification: Implemented a simple neural network for binary classification using the Tanh activation function.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-class Classification: Explored multi-class classification using a dataset on dart players, leveraging one-hot encoding and building a neural network with multiple dense layers.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Multi-label Classification: Tackled a multi-label classification problem with an irrigation machine dataset, where each sample can belong to multiple classes simultaneously.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Learning Curves: Visualized learning curves to understand model performance over epochs, helping to identify underfitting or overfitting.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Activation Functions: Experimented with different activation functions like ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh to understand their impact on model performance.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Batch Normalization: Explored the effects of batch normalization on model training and accuracy, comparing models with and without batch normalization layers.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Hyperparameter Tuning: Used RandomizedSearchCV to tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Intro to CNNs: Delved into Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using the MNIST dataset, understanding image preprocessing and building CNN architectures.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Intro to LSTMs: Explored Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction tasks, such as generating text sequences based on input.

üîó I've shared snippets of code and insights gained from each section of the project. Feel free to check out the full details on my GitHub repository [link to your repository].

üôå Excited to continue my journey in deep learning and explore more advanced topics ahead!
